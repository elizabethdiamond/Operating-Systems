# Operating-Systems

# Project 1: Simple Shell
A simple shell which is able to execute commands, redirect the standard input/output (​stdin/stdout​) of commands to files, pipe the output of commands to other commands, and carry out commands in the background (parsing, standard file descriptors, process cloning)

# Project 2: Threading Library
A user-space thread library, similar to the pthreads set of interfaces (scheduling(round robin), register/stack manipulation, thread state management)

# Project 3: Thread Synchronization
Expansion of threading library from project 2 to support thread synchronization (signal management, thread state-dependent scheduling, mutexes/barriers)

# Project 4: Thread Local Storage
Implementation for threads to store information that offers protection from other threads (memory management, memory pages, page protections, copy on write)

# Project 5: File Systems
A file system that runs on a Linux file system, not the kernel (inodes, disk management, indirect block mapping, bit manipulation)
